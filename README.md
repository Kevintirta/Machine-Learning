# Machine-Learning, Supervised learning

Hello Guys, 

My name is Kevin, 

In this project, i have developed a python script model to predict whether a credit card request will likely to be approved or not based on the previous data collected by the company. This project includes data cleaning, data manipulation/scaling,and fitting a logistic regression algorithm to build the credit card approval model.
In the model, we will separate the data into testing and training sets. Finally, At the end of the project, The model is able to achieve about 84% accuracy score which is good approximate to make credit card proposal filtering more efficient.

Library used in this project:
- sklearn 
- pandas 
- numpy

Thank you for reading!
